Once we have a list of opportunities that we're confident are a good fit for AI, we'll move toward Agent Development. There will be a rapid prototyping phase where we validate feasibility and solution design. Within weeks, we can run Agent POCs and green-light production ready agent development. Rapid development cycles are critical with AI in order to keep up with the pace of innovation in the industry.
