Once we have a list of opportunities that we collectively believe are a good fit for AI, we begin a rapid prototyping phase where we validate feasibility and solution design. This is a highly collaborative process with your team as we work together to refine requirements, iterate on designs, and test early versions of the solution. We prioritize speed and learning during this phase.
