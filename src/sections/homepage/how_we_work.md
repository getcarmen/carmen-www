## About us

Carmen AI is a Seattle-based software consultancy that builds and deploys custom AI solutions for your business.

We bring decades of expertise in data engineering, machine learning, and modern AI, along with entrepreneurial experience that helps us bridge your business goals with the right technology.

We don't believe in one-size-fits-all AI or chasing hype cycles. We're pragmatists focused on shipping solutions that drive measurable impact for you and your team.

## How we work

Instead, we start by partnering with you to understand your specific business challenges and goals. We assess your existing data infrastructure, workflows, and team capabilities to identify high-impact opportunities where AI can make a real difference. Then we work closely with your team to co-create solutions that are tailored to your unique context.

After gaining a deep understanding of your needs, we prototype and validate AI concepts quickly to ensure they deliver tangible value. If successful, we move into full-scale development and deployment.

We never outsource or offshore our engineering work; all development is done by our in-house team of experts. We prioritize transparency and collaboration throughout the process, providing regular updates and involving your team at every stage.
